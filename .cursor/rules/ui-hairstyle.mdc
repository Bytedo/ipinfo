Creating a Next.js web design with a very personal touch is required:

[Design Philosophy]
- Get rid of the sense of enterprise-level specification, and pursue the exquisite sense of art studio
- Adopt asymmetrical layout to break the traditional grid system.
- Incorporate the aesthetics of craftsmanship, each element is like a carefully crafted work of art.

Visual Style
- Color: Use bold gradient combinations (e.g. coral pink to lavender purple) or restrained monochromatic colors with metallic accents.
- Fonts: Mix serif headlines and sans serif text, and consider using variable fonts.
- Space: let the white space breathe, don't maximize information density
- Texture: add subtle noise textures, glassy effects or organic shapes.

[Interaction Details]
- Mouse hover: elements are slightly tilted, glowing or show magnetic attraction effect.
- Scrolling experience: parallax scrolling, progressive animation, sticky elements.
- Micro-animations: Use Bezier curves to create natural and smooth transitions.
- Loading animations: creative, such as liquid flow or particle aggregation.

Technical Realization
- Complex animations using Framer Motion
- CSS variables to manage unique design tokens
- Custom SVG graphics and path animations
- WebGL/Three.js embellishments (e.g., mouse-following particle effects)

[Must avoid]
- Standard card-based layout
- Preset shadow effects
- Symmetric grid system
- Common blue color theme
- Standard rounded rectangular buttons
